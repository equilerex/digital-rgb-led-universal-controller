# Digital-rgb-led-universal-controller
My little universal controller library which i use for all of my projects running WS2812 / WS2812b strips. 
Contains a well curated set of animations which fit most simple project straight out of the box

 
### Features
* Brightness control potentiometer
* color modifier potentiometer (works on most animations)
* mode button
    * 1 click to switch mode
    * Hold 3-4 seconds to adjust brightness (20%-100%)
    * Hold 5-9 seconds to reduce LED strip length by 50 (minimum 50 LEDs)
    * Hold 10+ seconds to increase LED strip length by 50 (maximum 1000 LEDs)

### Animations
(will try to upload a video soon)
* rainbowWithGlitter - scrolling rainbow with some random white glitter here and there
* rainbow_march - same as above but without clitter
* sinelon 
* two_sin
* pop_fade
* confetti
* juggle,
* bpm
* threeSinTwo
# ESP32 Basic Wearable FastLED Controller

A versatile ESP32-based controller for LED wearables and projects using the FastLED library. This project offers multiple animation patterns, user control via buttons, optional OLED display support, and easy configuration.

## Features

- **Multiple Animation Categories:**
  - Slow & Soothing animations (Breathing, Aurora, Color Meditation, etc.)
  - Solid Colors
  - High BPM animations
  - Party Vibe animations
  - Psychedelic animations
  - And more!

- **Hardware Control:**
  - Single button interface for switching animations and entering different modes
  - Long-press functionality for adjusting brightness and LED count
  - Optional OLED display for status information

- **ESP32 Optimized:**
  - Designed for ESP32-C3 boards (can be adapted for other ESP32 variants)
  - Low power consumption for battery-powered wearables
  - Efficient memory usage
  - Enhanced watchdog timer handling to prevent boot loops
  - Ultra-safe LED initialization for reliability

## Watchdog and Safe Boot Changes

Recent updates have significantly improved stability and reliability:

1. **Ultra-Safe LED Initialization**:
   - Multi-stage initialization starting with just 1 LED
   - Progressive brightness ramping to prevent power surges
   - Extensive yield() calls to feed the watchdog timer
   - Multiple safety delays between critical operations

2. **Watchdog Timer Management**:
   - Optional watchdog disabling during critical initialization
   - Adjustable watchdog timeout settings in Config.h
   - Recovery mechanisms if the main loop takes too long

3. **Memory Optimization**:
   - LED arrays properly allocated on the heap
   - Smart memory management with proper cleanup
   - More conservative default values for LED count and brightness

4. **Emergency Recovery**:
   - System can detect when it's struggling and enter safe mode
   - Emergency shutdown procedure to reset to a known good state

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32-C3 development board (or other ESP32 variants with minor modifications)
- WS2812B LED strip (or other FastLED compatible LEDs)
- Momentary pushbutton
- Optional:
  - SSD1306 OLED display (128x64)
  - Potentiometers for brightness/color adjustment

## Wiring Diagram

Basic wiring:
- Connect LED strip data pin to GPIO8 (configurable in Config.h)
- Connect button to GPIO9 (configurable in Config.h)
- Optional: Connect SSD1306 OLED display via I2C (SDA to GPIO5, SCL to GPIO6)

## Installation and Setup

### Using PlatformIO (Recommended)

1. **Install PlatformIO:**
   - Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Install the [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)

2. **Clone and Open the Project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-basic-wearable-fastled.git
   cd esp32-basic-wearable-fastled
   code .  # Open with VS Code
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   PlatformIO will automatically install the required libraries when you build.

4. **Configure the Project:**
   - Edit `src/config/Config.h` to match your hardware setup
   - Set `DEFAULT_NUM_LEDS` to your LED strip length
   - Set `LED_TYPE` to your LED strip type (default: WS2812)
   - Set `ENABLE_OLED` to 0 if you don't have an OLED display

5. **Build and Upload:**
   - Connect your ESP32 to your computer
   - Click the PlatformIO "Upload" button in VS Code
   - Or use the terminal commands:
     ```bash
     # First ensure all libraries are installed
     pio lib install
     
     # Then build and upload
     pio run -t upload
     ```

6. **Monitor Serial Output (Optional):**
   ```bash
   pio device monitor
   ```

### Common PlatformIO Commands

note: if you want to remove (or add) any animations, just remove from or add names to `SimplePatternList` object
